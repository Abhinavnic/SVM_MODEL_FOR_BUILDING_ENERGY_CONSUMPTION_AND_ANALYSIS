## __1. Overview:__
This project focuses on using Support Vector Machines (SVM) to optimize energy consumption in smart buildings. By leveraging historical energy usage data, the model predicts future consumption patterns and identifies anomalies, helping improve energy efficiency and reduce costs.

The study aims to:

- Develop an SVM-based predictive model for energy consumption forecasting.

- Evaluate model performance using metrics like MSE, MAE, RMSE, RÂ² score, and Accuracy.

- Provide insights that can assist in HVAC optimization and anomaly detection.

## __2. Implemented Algorithm: Support Vector Machines (SVM):__
Support Vector Machines (SVM) are effective for handling non-linear relationships between energy consumption and influencing factors such as occupancy, weather conditions, and time-based patterns.

### Model Characteristics:
- Kernel Trick: Uses RBF kernel to capture complex energy usage patterns.
- Hyperplane Optimization: Maximizes the margin between different energy usage states.
- Regularization: Prevents overfitting by balancing complexity and accuracy.
- Scalability: Works well for medium-sized datasets with well-defined energy consumption trends.

## __3. Dataset Used:__
The dataset consists of 3,840 records of energy consumption data, including:

- Time-based variables (hour, day, season).
- Environmental factors (temperature, humidity).
- Building-specific data (occupancy, HVAC usage).
