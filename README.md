## __1. Overview:__
This project focuses on using Support Vector Machines (SVM) to optimize energy consumption in smart buildings. By leveraging historical energy usage data, the model predicts future consumption patterns and identifies anomalies, helping improve energy efficiency and reduce costs.

The study aims to:

- Develop an SVM-based predictive model for energy consumption forecasting.

- Evaluate model performance using metrics like MSE, MAE, RMSE, RÂ² score, and Accuracy.

- Provide insights that can assist in HVAC optimization and anomaly detection.
